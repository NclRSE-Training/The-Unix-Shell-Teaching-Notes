## Listing in Reverse Chronological Order

By default, ```ls``` lists the contents of a directory in alphabetical order by name. The command ```ls -t``` lists items by time of last change instead of alphabetically. The command ```ls -r``` lists the contents of a directory in reverse order. Which file is displayed last when you combine the ```-t``` and ```-r ```options? Hint: You may need to use the ```-l``` option to see the last changed dates.

The most recently changed file is listed last when using -rt. This can be very useful for finding your most recent edits or checking to see if a new output file was written.
