The solution is 3.

1. shows all files whose names contain zero or more characters (<code>*</code>) followed by the letter <code>t</code>, then zero or more characters (<code>*</code>) followed by <code>ane.pdb</code>. This gives <code>ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb</code>.

2. shows all files whose names start with zero or more characters (<code>*</code>) followed by the letter <code>t</code>, then a single character (<code>?</code>), then <code>ne</code>. followed by zero or more characters (<code>*</code>). This will give us <code>octane.pdb</code> and <code>pentane.pdb</code> but doesnâ€™t match anything which ends in <code>thane.pdb</code>.

3. fixes the problems of option 2 by matching two characters (<code>??</code>) between <code>t</code> and <code>ne</code>. This is the solution.

4. only shows files starting with <code>ethane.</code>
