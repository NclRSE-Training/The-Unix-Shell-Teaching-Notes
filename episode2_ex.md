The ```-l``` option makes ```ls``` use a long listing format, showing not only the file/directory names but also additional information, such as the file size and the time of its last modification. If you use both the ```-h``` option and the ```-l``` option, this makes the file size ‘human readable’, i.e. displaying something like ```5.3K``` instead of ```5369```.
