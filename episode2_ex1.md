## 2.1 Exploring More ```ls``` Flags


You can also use two options at the same time. What does the command ```ls``` do when used with the ```-l``` option? What about if you use both the ```-l``` and the ```-h``` option?

Some of its output is about properties that we do not cover in this lesson (such as file permissions and ownership), but the rest should be useful nevertheless.

  The <code>-l</code> option makes <code>ls</code> use a long listing format, showing not only the file/directory names but also additional information, such as the file size and the time of its last modification. If you use both the <code>-h</code> option and the <code>-l</code> option, this makes the file size ‘human readable’, i.e. displaying something like <code>5.3K</code> instead of <code>5369</code>.
